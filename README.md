# LittleCParser
Paul Macfarlane
This repository contains a parser for the language Little C. Unfortunately it is not fully functional, however, it can still parse a reasonable file that contains the syntax of the Language little C, based on the specifications listed in the file "requirements.txt". I spent many, many hours on this project during the semester and am proud of my work. The program "parser.c" is the program that actually parses a little c program, while "programTest.txt" is a file written in little C syntax to test the parser.  
  
Note: As with many of my public repositories on Github, this repository contains work from a private repository for a class at Siena College. If you would like access to the private repository with the original commit history and workflow, email me at pj16macf@siena.edu.
